## Notes

- Documentation vs User guides?
    - Documentation ~OJS in an Hour (updated)
    - User guide ~ actual help within the software
- Formats & standards
    - End goal = everything on GitBook,
        - runs on Git,
        - allows versioning,
        - built-in translation support
        - uses markdown.
        - Exporting items to it seems to be doable
    - For some docs (Getting Found) easier to do broad edits in Google docs and import them into Gitbook later (Mike is experienced)
- Status update
    - [Learning OJS 2](https://www.gitbook.com/book/pkp/learning-ojs-2/details) (2.4.8) mostly needs proofreading
    - [Learning OJS 3](https://www.gitbook.com/book/pkp/ojs3/details) (small event happening soon) has received a lot of love recently - chapters 9 & 10 left to do - needs enhancing throughout
    - [Getting found](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PEQlRpwfJW2KnBAHLueAf3ruR2UFodBJGYDSlQQDUoA/edit?usp=sharing) - needs huge changes... very much out of date.
    - [Learning OMP](https://www.gitbook.com/book/pkp/learning-omp/details): lots of work needed - needs collaborators.
- Mike, Roger, Kevin to make first assessment


## Teams

## It’s a learning process

Thankyouthankyouthankyou :D <3

## Translations

Translator communities for software are there - hope to gear this up for documentation, is a different group.

## GitHub/GitBook

- Everybody: share GitHub details
- Mike will send around some documentation for using GitBook
- GettingFound remains a Google Doc for a while
- [ ] - Workflow discussion: Kevin can set up Google Hangout session to go through GitHub/Google Docs workflow - record for those who cannot make it.
